# odin-recipes

This the first project that I'm doing with the Odin Project.
The project is to create a webpage which will link to recipes & push the finalised project to github using git.

So far git seems a little confusing, and I've had one error with the html testing files where files needed to be merged. I'm not too sure what I did wrong, but eventually I managed to fix it, hopefully I'll avoid those errors with this project.

I will come back with an update once I have completed the project to give an overview of how it went.
