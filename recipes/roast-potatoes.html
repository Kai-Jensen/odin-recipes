    <h2>Ingredints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
      <li>1½ kg Maris Piper potatoes , cut into quarters, peelings reserved</li>
      <li>50g butter</li>
      <li>½ bunch of lemon thyme</li>
      <li>6 garlic cloves , lightly bashed</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 8. Add the oil to a large flameproof
      baking tray and put in the oven for the oil to heat up.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, tip in the potatoes and the
      peelings (to impart extra flavour) and simmer for 8-10 mins. Drain the
      potatoes and discard the peelings. Leave to steam-dry for 15 mins, then
      return the potatoes to the pan, put the lid on and gently shake to lightly
      rough up the edges.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Remove the tray from the oven and put directly on your hob over a medium
      heat. Add the butter to the hot oil and, using tongs, add the potatoes to
      the tray, one by one, carefully turning them in the fat, and leaving a
      little space between them. Reduce the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Nestle
      the lemon thyme in amongst the potatoes, along with the garlic. Sprinkle
      over the sea salt and return to the oven to roast for 1 hr, turning every
      once in a while, until golden and crisp.
